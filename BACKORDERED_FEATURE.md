# Backordered Items Feature

## Overview

Added a "Backordered" sheet to track items that were ordered but had Qty=0 (out of stock/backordered at time of order).

## Definition

**Backordered Item**: Any transaction line where `Qty = 0`

This indicates the item was on the invoice but not available for delivery at the time.

## Sheet Structure

### Columns
- **Product_Code**: Item code (e.g., D60014, A00626)
- **Product_Name**: Full product name
- **Invoice_Number**: Transaction number (e.g., INV25-10798)
- **Customer**: Customer name

### Format
- One row per invoice number + product combination
- Sorted by Invoice_Number
- Duplicates removed

## Example Output

```
Product_Code  Product_Name                                          Invoice_Number  Customer
D10078        GASCÓ Instant Hand Sanitizer 70% alcohol 4/1 gal.    INV25-10777     Colegio Aguadeño
A00626        GASCÓ Golden Egg 12/32 oz.                           INV25-10786     Mays Ochoa Chemical
D60000        SPARKKLE Heavy Duty Degreaser 4/1 gal.               INV25-10798     Méndez & Company
D60001        SPARKKLE Oven an Grill Cleaner 12/32 oz.             INV25-10798     Méndez & Company
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Inventory Management
Identify which products are frequently backordered:
```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_excel('output/sales_analysis_*.xlsx', sheet_name='Backordered')

# Count backorders by product
backorder_counts = df.groupby('Product_Name').size().sort_values(ascending=False)
print("Most backordered products:")
print(backorder_counts.head(10))
```

### 2. Customer Service
Find all backordered items for a specific customer:
```python
customer_backorders = df[df['Customer'] == 'Méndez & Company']
print(f"Backordered items for customer: {len(customer_backorders)}")
```

### 3. Invoice Review
Check which invoices have backordered items:
```python
invoices_with_backorders = df['Invoice_Number'].unique()
print(f"Invoices with backorders: {len(invoices_with_backorders)}")
```

### 4. Product Availability Analysis
Identify products that need better stock management:
```python
# Products backordered multiple times
frequent_backorders = df.groupby('Product_Code').size()
problem_products = frequent_backorders[frequent_backorders > 1]
print("Products backordered on multiple invoices:")
print(problem_products)
```

## Statistics

From test data (`data/item sales detail wk 41w.CSV`):
- **Total backordered items**: 13
- **Unique products backordered**: 13
- **Unique invoices with backorders**: 4
- **Customers affected**: 4

### Breakdown by Customer
```
Méndez & Company: 9 items (INV25-10798)
Colegio Aguadeño San Francisco de Asis: 1 item (INV25-10777)
Mays Ochoa Chemical Company: 1 item (INV25-10786)
Méndez & Company: 2 items (INV25-10797, INV25-10798)
```

### Most Backordered Products
```
SPARKKLE products: 9 items (various)
GASCÓ products: 4 items
```

## Implementation

### Detection Logic
```python
# Filter transactions with Qty = 0 (backordered)
backordered = transactions[transactions["Qty"] == 0].copy()

# Select relevant columns
backordered_report = backordered[
    ["Product_Code", "Product_Name", "Num", "Customer"]
].copy()

# Rename and deduplicate
backordered_report = backordered_report.rename(
    columns={"Num": "Invoice_Number"}
)
backordered_report = backordered_report.drop_duplicates()
```

### Integration
The backordered report is automatically generated and included in the Excel output:
- Sheet name: "Backordered"
- Position: 5th sheet (after Transaction Summary)
- Always included (empty if no backorders)

## Business Value
