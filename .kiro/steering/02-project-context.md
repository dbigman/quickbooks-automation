# Project Context & Understanding

1. **Documentation First:**

   * **Always** check and review relevant project documentation **before** starting any task:

     * Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
     * Design documents and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
     * `README.md` (project overview, setup, patterns, technology stack)
     * `docs/architecture.md` (system architecture, component relationships)
     * `docs/technical.md` (technical specifications, established patterns)
     * `tasks/tasks.md` (current development tasks, requirements)
     * `CHANGELOG.md` (version history and notable changes)
     * **QuickBooks Integration**: `QuickBooks_Desktop_qbXML_ Report_Query_Guide.md` for any qbXML report generation
   * If documentation is missing, unclear, or conflicts with the request, **ask for clarification**.

2. **Architecture Adherence:**

   * Understand and respect module boundaries, data flow, system interfaces, and component dependencies outlined in `docs/architecture.md`.
   * Validate that changes comply with the established architecture. Warn and propose compliant solutions if a violation is detected.

3. **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:**

   * Reference `README.md` and `docs/technical.md` to understand and utilize existing patterns and technologies.
   * Exhaust options using existing implementations before proposing new patterns or libraries.
