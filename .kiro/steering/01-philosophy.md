# Core Philosophy

1. **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
2. **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested.
3. **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
4. **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
5. **Collaboration:** Foster effective teamwork between human developers and the AI assistant, aligning on shared goals and responsibilities.
