# Master Production Schedule Calculator

A Python command-line tool that integrates with Odoo 18 ERP systems to calculate Master Production Schedules (MPS). The system fetches sales orders, inventory levels, and Bill of Materials (BOM) data from Odoo, then performs Material Requirements Planning (MRP) calculations to generate production schedules and delivery plans.

## Core Functionality

- **Odoo 18 API Integration**: Connects via JSON-RPC to fetch real-time business data
- **Order Prioritization**: Supports multiple algorithms (Priority, FIFO, LIFO, EDD) for order scheduling
- **Material Requirements Planning (MRP)**: Calculates component needs based on BOMs and inventory levels
- **Inventory Shortage Analysis**: Identifies and classifies material shortages by severity
- **Production Scheduling**: Generates daily production plans with configurable capacity constraints
- **Excel Reporting**: Exports comprehensive reports and individual analysis sheets
- **Delivery Scheduling**: Creates logistics-focused delivery schedules
- **KPI Analytics**: Calculates delivery performance metrics and operational insights

## Key Business Value

The tool helps manufacturing companies optimize production planning by providing data-driven insights into order prioritization, material shortages, and delivery schedules. It bridges the gap between ERP data and actionable production planning.

## Target Users

Manufacturing companies using Odoo 18 who need automated production planning and scheduling capabilities with detailed shortage analysis and Excel-based reporting.
