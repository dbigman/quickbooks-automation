# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The QuickBooks Auto Reporter is an automated data extraction and reporting system designed to continuously monitor QuickBooks Desktop and export multiple report types to designated folders. The system provides scheduled execution with configurable intervals, change detection to avoid redundant exports, and professional Excel formatting. It serves as a bridge between QuickBooks Desktop and external data consumers, enabling automated data workflows without manual intervention.

The application supports 9 different report types including Open Sales Orders, Profit & Loss statements, Sales analytics, and Accounts Payable/Receivable aging reports. It features both GUI and command-line interfaces, and comprehensive diagnostics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: QuickBooks Desktop Integration

4. IF the QuickBooks SDK is not installed THEN the application SHALL detect this condition and provide installation guidance
5. WHEN multiple connection methods are available THEN the application SHALL try: (1) open QuickBooks file, (2) user-selected file, (3) configured company file path
6. WHEN authentication is required THEN the application SHALL use QuickBooks SDK authentication with local connection modes
7. IF connection fails after all attempts THEN the application SHALL log detailed error information including COM error codes

### Requirement 2: Multi-Report Data Extraction

6. IF an error occurs during polling THEN the application SHALL log the error and continue with the next scheduled cycle
7. WHEN the user stops automatic mode THEN the application SHALL complete the current operation and then halt polling

### Requirement 4: Change Detection and Timestamped Snapshots

**User Story:** As a data consumer, I want the application to only save new report versions when data actually changes, so that I don't accumulate redundant duplicate files.

2. IF a hash file exists for the report THEN the application SHALL compare the new hash with the stored hash
3. WHEN the hash matches the previous hash THEN the application SHALL NOT create a timestamped snapshot
4. WHEN the hash differs from the previous hash THEN the application SHALL create timestamped CSV and Excel files with format: `{Report_Name}_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` and `{Report_Name}_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`
5. WHEN data changes are detected THEN the application SHALL update the hash file with the new hash value
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the application SHALL always update the non-timestamped base files (`{Report_Name}.csv` and `{Report_Name}.xlsx`)
7. IF hash computation fails THEN the application SHALL treat the report as changed and create a timestamped snapshot

### Requirement 5: Multi-Format Export (CSV and Excel)

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want reports exported in both CSV and professionally formatted Excel formats, so that I can use the data in various tools and present it professionally.

6. WHEN creating Excel files THEN the application SHALL use openpyxl for professional formatting

### Requirement 6: GUI Interface with Real-Time Status

**User Story:** As a business user, I want a graphical interface that shows real-time status for each report, so that I can monitor the application without reading log files.
