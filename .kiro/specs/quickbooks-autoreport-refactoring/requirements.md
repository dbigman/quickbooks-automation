# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the monolithic `quickbooks_autoreport.py` file (1400+ lines) into a well-structured, maintainable codebase following the project's architectural principles. The refactoring aims to improve code quality, testability, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

### Current State

The existing `quickbooks_autoreport.py` file contains:
- QuickBooks Desktop COM integration
- Multiple report generation logic (9 report types)
- CSV and Excel export functionality
- Tkinter GUI interface
- CLI interface
- Scheduled execution with timers
- Diagnostics and error handling
- Settings persistence
- Enhanced error messages and user guidance

### Goals

1. **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns into focused modules following hexagonal architecture
2. **Type Safety**: Add comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase
3. **Testability**: Enable unit and integration testing by separating pure logic from side effects
4. **Maintainability**: Reduce file sizes to under 300 lines per module
5. **Reusability**: Create shared components usable by both CLI and GUI
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain all existing functionality without breaking changes
