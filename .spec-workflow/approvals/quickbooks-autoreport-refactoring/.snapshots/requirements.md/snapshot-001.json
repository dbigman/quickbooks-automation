The refactoring aims to improve code quality, testability, and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.\n\n### Current State\n\nThe existing `quickbooks_autoreport.py` file contains:\n- QuickBooks Desktop COM integration\n- Multiple report generation logic (9 report types)\n- CSV and Excel export functionality\n- Tkinter GUI interface\n- CLI interface\n- Scheduled execution with timers\n- Diagnostics and error handling\n- Settings persistence\n- Enhanced error messages and user guidance\n\n### Goals\n\n1. **Modular Architecture**: Separate concerns into focused modules following hexagonal architecture\n2. **Type Safety**: Add comprehensive type hints throughout the codebase\n3. **Testability**: Enable unit and integration testing by separating pure logic from side effects\n4. **Maintainability**: Reduce file sizes to under 300 lines per module\n5. **Reusability**: Create shared components usable by both CLI and GUI\n6. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain all existing functionality without breaking changes\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Modular Project Structure\n\n**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized into logical modules so that I can easily navigate, understand, and maintain the code.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1.
