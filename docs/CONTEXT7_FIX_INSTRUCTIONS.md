# Context7 MCP Server Fix Instructions

## Issue Identified
The Context7 MCP server was not working because it requires an API key for authentication.

## Root Cause
The Context7 MCP server (`@upstash/context7-mcp`) requires:
1. `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable for authentication
2. Proper auto-approval configuration for its tools

## Fix Applied
Updated `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` with:
- Added `CONTEXT7_API_KEY` environment variable placeholder
- Set `DEFAULT_MINIMUM_TOKENS` to "1000" 
- Added auto-approval for `resolve-library-id` and `get-library-docs` tools

## Required Action
**CONTEXT7 API KEY HAS BEEN CONFIGURED:**

✅ API Key: `ctx7sk-0a4954f7-77cc-4938-8920-5e294ab4bfa4`
✅ Added to `.env` file
✅ Updated `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`

**FINAL STEP - RESTART MCP SERVERS:**
1. Use Command Palette → "MCP: Reconnect Servers"
2. Or restart Kiro IDE

This is required for the new configuration to take effect.

## Configuration After Fix
```json
"context7": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "@upstash/context7-mcp"
  ],
  "env": {
    "DEFAULT_MINIMUM_TOKENS": "1000",
    "CONTEXT7_API_KEY": "your-actual-api-key-here"
  },
  "disabled": false,
  "autoApprove": [
    "resolve-library-id",
    "get-library-docs"
  ]
}
```

## Verification
After applying the API key and restarting:
1. Test with: `resolve-library-id` for a library like "react"
2. Test with: `get-library-docs` to fetch documentation

## Alternative Solution
If you don't have a Context7 API key or don't want to use this service:
- Set `"disabled": true` in the context7 configuration
- This will prevent errors while keeping other MCP servers functional
